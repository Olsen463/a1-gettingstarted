This project shows a brief overview of me including my hobbies and academic career at WPI. 
For Technical achievements I used many different tags such as img, div, footer, a, and header. I also created a javascript animation to fade the background colors within the color pallete mentioned below. 
For Design achievements I created a color pallete (as seen in WebwareA1ColorScheme.png) based on some of my favorite colors and implemented CSS sheets based off 
that color scheme. As mentioned above the background color shifts from one color within the pallete to another which is not implemented on the css sheet but within the javascript.
